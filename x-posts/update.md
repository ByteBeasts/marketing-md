🚀 *ByteBeasts has come a long way since our first spark of inspiration during the Starknet HackerHouse in Brussels, July 2024.*

It was our first time building on blockchain—and also our first hackathon.

The vision wasn’t clear yet, but the seed was planted. 🌱

**2/**
Soon after, we flew to Devcon 7 and joined the very first *Dojo Day*. There, we presented the **first version of ByteBeast Tamagotchi**—back then, it was called *BabyBeast* 👶🧬

A simple but fun Tamagotchi-style game.
And… we won 2nd place in the spooky edition of the Dojo Game Jam! 🎃🏆

**3/**
After Devcon, we weren’t sure about the future of ByteBeasts or BabyBeasts.

But then it clicked: why not unify all our ideas into **one powerful concept**?

➡️ **ByteBeasts are unique on-chain creatures.**
And from this truth, a universe was born.

---

**4/**
ByteBeasts became more than a game—it’s a **universe of on-chain beasts**.

And ByteBeast Tamagotchi? That’s our **first release.**
But now, it’s evolved into something much deeper…

👾 + 🤖 = 💙

---

**5/**
ByteBeast Tamagotchi is now powered by **AI**.

Your beast will not only react to your actions—it’ll track your **emotions**, goals, and energy.
It becomes your *companion*—someone who listens, reflects, and grows with you every day.

---

**6/**
It’s a gamified feedback loop:

🫵 You care for your ByteBeast.
🧠 And it cares for *you*.
➡️ Tracking goals, emotions, and tasks.
➡️ Giving insights and support—like a little AI-powered coach meets digital pet.

**7/**
We're building a **consumer app** for:

* Nostalgic Tamagotchi lovers 💾
* Anyone who needs a smart, judgment-free daily companion 🧠💬

And now, ByteBeast Tamagotchi is about to **launch inside the World App** by @worldcoin 🌍

---

**8/**
That means:
🔥 30M+ potential users
🛠️ Powered by @dojoengine
🧬 Onchain logic on Starknet
👻 Invisible wallet by @cavosxyz
🤝 Real humans, real utility

We’re combining infra, community, and design to launch at scale.

---

**9/**
We're still in the early stages—but we’re not afraid to say it:

📣 **ByteBeasts will become the #1 consumer app on Starknet.**

This is just the beginning.
Follow us at @0xByteBeasts to witness the evolution. 🧬🐾
